For anything that

You code should always be indented while typing. Do not wait till end of your typing.
In the code below, observe that whenever a curly bracket, { starts, following lines start after a small gap.
Whenver curly bracket } is closed, following lines do not have that gap.
This helps to quickly understand which lines are inside a loop / condition / method and which lines are outside.

public class Q1
{  
  public static void main(String args[])
  {
    int x = 0, y =0;
    int sum = 0;
    while (x < 10){
      y = x - 3;
      y = 40;
      while (y > 22){
        if ((sum > 30) && (sum < 40)) 
          sum = sum + x * 2 ;
        else if ((sum > 40) && (sum < 50)) 
          sum = sum + x * 3; 
        else 
          sum = sum + 23;
        System.out.println(sum);
        y = y - 10;
      }
      x += 2;
    }
  }
}
